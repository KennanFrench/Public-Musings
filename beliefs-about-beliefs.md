## Beliefs About Beliefs

To state the obvious, I think that everyone should strive to have their beliefs be as correct as possible.
There are so many things to have stances on that everyone, even someone who devotes a great deal of time and attention to getting them right, is likely to be wrong about some of them. 
For instance, I think that some of my opinions are almost definitely wrong, but it's impossible for me to, at any given point in time, identify which opnions those are.
After all, if I knew which ones they were, it would be easy enough to change them and then be right about everything.
Rather, the process of correcting your beliefs is one of research, discovery, and reflection.
I have noticed that often, before I change my mind about something, there is a period of unease or cognitive dissonance about that belief.
As it happens, I can identify right now some beliefs that give me this feeling.
Ideally, this would be enough to get to a state of mostly-correct beliefs, and that would be good enough.
However, it leads to a different issue: One's confidence that a belief is correct is a poor indicator of whether it is *actually* correct. \[Citation needed\]

It may be true that for most things, people are pretty accurate at judging how confident they should be in their beliefs; that is definitely something for me to research further.
But at least in principle, two people can hold opposing beliefs about something and both genuinely have zero doubt in their mind that they are wrong.
This situation happens enough (in many contexts, from events witnessed from different, misleading perspectives to strongly-held, diametrically opposed religious beliefs) that it leads me to be suspicious of anyone's estimation that they are correct about something, my own estimations included.

Yet I have hope that high degrees of confidence can be achieved in a justifiable way.
Of course, the justification (in every case I can think of) is evidence and good statistical thinking.
There's more to this, but I'm going to take some time to think about how I think about this before writing more.
