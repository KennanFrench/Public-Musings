## Policy Lightning Round

Inspired by an interview with John Ossoff (current U.S. Senator from Georgia, I believe candidate for same when the interview was given) that I saw recently, this is a place for intentionally-terse opinions on various policy areas.
I don't have any plans to run for office; people just like to talk about politics.
There was no thought given to the ordering of topics or questions; they were picked willy-nilly from many sources, as well as my own head.
I haven't written on any of these topics here yet, so maybe this will be a good place to start choosing topics from.
As I write on them over time, I will link the more detailed opinions from here.
Maybe I will even eventually combine this into the main readme, or make it the readme of a future subdirectory.

That's it for now!
I deliberately didn't include any foreign policy or healthcare policy.
I am strongly of the opinion that, within the context of the U.S., both of these domains are far too complicated for anyone to have a truly informed opinion on.
Yes, this includes you.
Yes, this includes your favorite congressperson, healthcare official, or foreign policy wonk.

Anyways, as with everything in this repository, feel free to open an issue with comments, questions, or suggestions!
