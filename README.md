## What is this?

This repository is a place for me to put my thoughts and beliefs on various topics.
There is going to be a *wide* range of topics; everything from music and games I enjoy to economics and social/political issues.
I will try to cite things that need citation.
Feel free to open an issue if you disagree with something, think I'm missing a necessary citation, or just to discuss whatever!
I may at some times write things and put them here encrypted.
This will allow me to later publish the secret key if I choose to make those thoughts public and still get all the benefits of this system.
Also, a note: this is (and always will be, by design) a work in progress.
I likely won't update a file right away when I change my mind about its contents, and I am starting from an empty repository.
Writing takes time, citations take time, and I don't know how often I'll feel like writing.

It will start as just some top-level markdown files, but I plan to eventually group them into a directory structure when it makes sense to.
There are several reasons I think the format of a repository of markdown files is nice:

1) I can use as many or as few words as I want.

2) Version control!
The ability to see how I've changed my mind on things over time seems interesting.

3) Related to the above point, the "default" view (the repository home page, on the most recent master commit) is always the most up-to-date version of my thoughts but older versions are still available.

4) I can use vim to write ðŸ™‚

The main place I shout thoughts into the void right now is [Twitter](https://twitter.com/KennanFrench), but that fails point 1) and requires extra work both on my part and everyone else's part to get points 2) and 3).
I considered starting a blog, but I don't think that handles point 2) as well as git history does.
There are solutions for point 4) for both blogs and Twitter, but vim is a more "native" editor here.

## Why are you doing this?

This is first and foremost a personal exercise.
Collecting my thoughts, putting words to them, and (especially) supporting them with citations helps them to become better over time.
Hopefully, this exercise I also don't do much longform writing these days, and this should help fix that. 

I am *not* doing this because I think that I have any special insight on the world, or out of some solipsistic idea that my ideas are the important ones.
Indeed, if this exercise works out the way that I expect, I would encourage anyone to do this (and for anyone to take anyone else's thoughts seriously and in good faith (which I would encourage regardless of how this exercise goes)).

## Why here, in a public GitHub repo?

There are two questions here: "Why public?" and "Why GitHub?".
The first is more important, and I would answer it by saying that being transparent and open to discussion is *usually* more valuable than the privacy of keeping your thoughts to yourself.
This tradeoff sometimes going the other way is roughly equivalent to the cases where I might put an encrypted file here.
As to the second question, the decision to put this on GitHub was mostly arbitrary.
I use GitLab at work, and haven't used GitHub very much, so it seemed like a good way to learn a little bit about the differences.
