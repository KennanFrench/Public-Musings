## My adventures in making skyr

### What is skyr?

Skyr is an Icelandic type of yogurt (I've also heard that it's technically a cheese, though I forget why; regardless, you eat it like yogurt).
It's tasty, very thick, and has way more protein and helpful bacteria than most yogurt.

### Why am I making it?

1) I like it (see "It's tasty" and the health benefits) and making it is cheaper than buying it.

2) Simple recipe: Heat milk, cool milk, add some skyr as a starter (much like sourdough starter), keep warm and then refrigerate.

3) Deceptively hard to get right!
I'll talk about that more below.
Obviously, I didn't know this when I first started.

4) I love self-feeding recipes!
They're so cool.
I don't have a sourdough starter going, because I don't want to commit to making it regularly, but my plan is to make a new batch of skyr each week; this should only be a commitment of about 30 minutes of active work, as it's mostly waiting.

5) Iceland is high up (probably #1, really) on my list of countries I'd like to visit if this pandemic ever ends.

### Story time! Why's it deceptively hard?

As I write this, I'm in the process of maybe, if I had to guess, my 8th attempt at making skyr at home.
I've had two moderate successes, in that the last two batches have seemed to allow the bacteria to proliferate and the end result tasted pretty much like Siggi's (the one brand of skyr that my grocery store carries, which I've been eating with lunch during quarantine and using as my starter).
However, both batches turned out with a texture more like cottage cheese than thick yogurt.
Since it's not a particularly popular food outside of Iceland, it's hard to find guidance on problems like this.
(Big shoutout to /u/Bignezzy on Reddit, whose [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Iceland/comments/g414eq/made_some_lemon_flavored_skyr/) on /r/Iceland is where I learned about skyr in the first place and who helped me get my first semi-successful batch.)
So for the batch I'm working on now, I've turned to [this yogurt troubleshooting guide](https://www.kitchenstewardship.com/homemade-yogurt-troubleshooting-guide/) in hopes that my texture problem is the same.
What I'm doing differently this batch, based on that guide, is keeping a much closer eye on the temperature during the skyr's rest peroid.

Now would be a good time to take an aside and talk first about my "setup" as it were, and second about my recipe.

My pot for heating the milk is a 6-quart stainless steel stock pot.
It's much larger than necessary for the amount I make in one batch (1 liter of milk), but the only other pot I own was starting to leave mysterious black flakes in it, so here we are.
(Plus, the very large surface area to volume ratio of this pot does help reduce the variance in temperature of the milk.)
I've got a ceramic stovetop, for what that's worth, but I don't think that changes much about skyr making.
And finally, to keep the skyr warm while it's resting, I use [this adorable crock pot](https://www.etsy.com/listing/277217756/vintage-rival-crock-ette-1-quart-slow), or one much like it (mine is one my family has had ever since I can remember, but if it's not this exact model it's a very very similar one).
A few notable qualities of this crock pot: it's small (the 1 liter of milk I use fills it almost to the brim), it has no temperature control (it's either plugged in or it's off), and, seriously, look how cute it is.
I've found its temperature without the lid to be about 120Â°F.
Finally, I'm using the [Thermapen Mk4](https://www.thermoworks.com/Thermapen-Mk4) as my thermometer.
Yes, I realize that that's an insane amount of money to spend on a thermometer, but Alton Brown said that that was his reaction too but that it really is worth it.
I'm not yet convinced that it was worth what I spent, but I also haven't used it for much besides skyr yet.

As far as my current, semi-successful recipe goes, it's sort of a combination of the recipe /u/Bignezzy put in the comments of the post linked above and the recipe I found [here](https://icelandmag.is/article/make-your-own-skyr).
I use a liter of whole milk (many of my failed attempts used skim; this was a suggestion of /u/Bignezzy), and otherwise pretty much follow the first recipe.
As I write this, I'm realizing that I'd been meaning to use the ratio of milk to starter from the second recipe, but accidentally have been using twice that.
That will be something to fix for next time.
The rennet was another suggestion that fixed problems I was having.
[This](https://cheesemaking.com/products/liquid-animal-rennet/?variant=8059863334957) is the rennet I use.
As I understand it, you're supposed to dilute it with water; I've been using the quantites I used to [test my rennet](https://cheesemaking.com/blogs/learn/faq-rennet-for-cheese-making) (.5tsp rennet in .5C water) and that's seemed to work fine.

So, getting back to story time, you've probably noticed that three things I've mentioned are related: that this time I'm going to keep a closer eye on the skyr's resting temperature, that my crockpot's one temperature is 120Â°F, and that the recipe says to keep it at 110Â°F for 4 hours.
In my last batch, I checked the temperature about half an hour after I first put it in the crock pot and it was still around 110Â°, but I checked again after the 4 hours and it had climbed all the way to 135Â°!
So my plan this time is to check the temperature every half hour or so and if it's above 115Â°, unplug the crockpot.
The skyr seems to hold heat pretty well (I suspect that's why it got so far above 120Â° in the first place), so I'll leave the crock pot unplugged until the next time I check it and then, likely, plug it back in and repeat until the 4 hours are up.

That's about all I have for now, other than that I'd like to quickly describe some of my failed attempts.
I tried a few times to follow more closely the second recipe, and went through several combinations of it and the first recipe.
Each time, it refused to "set" and by the time I was done, it was still just milk with some store-bought skyr mixed in.
I made the switch from skim to whole milk in the same batch that I started using rennet, so I can't say for sure which change solved the "setting" problem, but some combination of those changes did it.
The one failed batch I've had since making that switch was just me forgetting to let the milk cool to 110Â° before I put it in the crock pot with the rennet and starter skyr.
That batch did set (again into the same cottage cheese texture I'm trying to fix now), but tasted pretty awful and pretty unlike what skyr should taste like.
Would not recommend.

### Update 2020/09/29

The last batch turned out with the cottage cheese texture as well ðŸ˜¢
I have several new things to try for next time though.
First (as mentioned in the OP), there's fixing the ratio of milk to starter.
Second, when I was checking the temperature of the skyr as it rested, it warmed to 130Â° much faster than I expected.
It was still around 110Â° when I checked it after the first half hour, but by the next check, it was already up to 130Â°!
I think next time, I'll let the crock pot get up to 110Â° before I transfer the skyr, then unplug it once I do and leave it like that with the lid on.
Then I'll check the temperature and plug it in (for much less than half an hour, maybe 10 minutes or so) only when it needs to get back up to 110Â°.
I think the rennet and the skyr bacteria should be fine down to 90Â° or so, but I'll try to keep it in the 100-110Â° range.
The last thing I will change for next time is how I separate the curds.
I've been straining it with a cheesecloth as soon as I take it off of its resting heat, but after looking up what a yogurt strainer is, I think I might be supposed to let it chill and strain at the same time.

(Endnote to this update: I think this is probably how I'll continue to update this post, leaving the OP intact and appending updates as I experiment with new batches (at least until I get to a point where I can consistently get everything right, after which I'll probably do a lot of restructuring))

### Update 2020/10/04

Well, I made a mistake that I'd already made: I forgot to let it cool from 180Â° to 110Â° before mixing in the starter and rennet.
I'm going to try and salvage it by letting that mixture cool to 110Â° and then adding it to some starter and rennet that haven't been ruined, but I don't have high hopes.
I should leave myself a note above my stove next time to not do this.
