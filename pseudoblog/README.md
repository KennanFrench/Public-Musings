## What is this?

This folder is my first attempt at categorizing this repository.
Since this repository has a sort of dual purpose (a noncomprehensive set of my most recent opinions, and a place for longer form writing in a sort-of-Twitter-sort-of-blog style), I think I might keep the root level of the repository mostly empty and have most entries be either in /pseudoblog/ somewhere or in /beliefs/ (not yet extant) somewhere.
Probably, /beliefs/ will be further categorized and /pseudoblog/ will not.
The two potentially useful categorizations for /pseudoblog/ that I can think of are both time-based: something date-based, like /pseudoblog/09 September/ for example, or something more qualitatively "period in my life"-based, like /pseudoblog/quarantine/.
The first seems redundant, as one could simply clone this repository and sort the files by date if the date was important (which I don't think it will be for many posts).
The second seems like it might be more interesting and useful, but it might get strange when periods overlap.
For example, if quarantine ends up lasting a few years and in that time I were to buy a house, "moving" or "buying a house" would be reasonable categories to have.
But should it then be /pseudoblog/quarantine/moving/ or /pseudoblog/quarantine/ and /pseudoblog/moving/?
If the first, what if quarantine ends in the middle of my move?
If the second, what about posts that aren't about quarantine or moving, but which I happen to write during both of those periods?
So for now I'll leave /pseudoblog/ uncategorized; after all, right now there's only this readme and one post in it.
